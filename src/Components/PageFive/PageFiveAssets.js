  userCommentone: `This is an unusually large advance over previous models, especially in raw computing power, but also in fun things like screen and headphone support. This Amazon listing has two different processors, the M1 Pro (listed as 16-Core GPU "style") and the M1 Max (32-Core GPU). I'll call one the Pro, the other the Max. I got the base Pro, but much of what I'll say applies to both, and I'll have some comments specifically about the Max too. (MBP below = MacBook Pro.)`,
